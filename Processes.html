	  <h2>OIL PAINTING</h2>
    <p>   
My art process in oils is slow, layered, and deeply meditative. It usually begins long before I ever touch a canvas—with a feeling, a moment, or an image that lingers in my mind. Inspiration comes from all over: soft lighting in a photograph I saved on Pinterest, the mood in a piece by one of my favorite painters, or the way two unexpected colors sit together in someone else’s work. I spend time collecting and arranging references, often creating digital collages or mood boards that help me visualize the atmosphere I want to create. I don’t always know exactly what the final painting will look like, but I follow whatever gives me that spark of curiosity.

Once I have a direction, I prepare my canvas and begin with an underpainting. This is where the structure of the piece starts to form. I usually work in a monochromatic palette—burnt umber, raw sienna, or a mix of ultramarine and burnt sienna—using thin, transparent washes. This layer lets me focus entirely on value, contrast, and composition without getting distracted by color. It’s a quiet phase of the process, almost like sketching in paint, and I love the ghostly, raw quality it gives to the work. Sometimes I’ll leave parts of the underpainting visible in the final piece because I enjoy how it adds depth and history to the surface.

After that, I begin building the painting in layers, working from thin to thick, dark to light. I use a mix of soft and bristle brushes, depending on the texture I want, and sometimes I bring in palette knives or even rags to break up the surface and loosen the edges. One of the things I love most about oils is their open time—they stay wet long enough for me to blend, push, and shift things around without rushing. I often glaze over dried layers with thin transparent color to add richness or atmosphere, which is something I picked up from studying classical techniques.

Even though I plan my paintings, I try not to hold on too tightly to any one version. Sometimes the process leads me somewhere I didn’t expect—maybe the underpainting feels more powerful than I thought, or I fall in love with an accidental brushstroke. I’ve learned to trust those moments. They remind me that the process is alive and responsive. I also make space for looking—stepping back from the canvas, flipping it upside down, or photographing it to see it with fresh eyes. That quiet observation is just as important as the painting itself.

Throughout, I constantly refer back to the artists who inspire me—whether it's the drama of Caravaggio’s lighting, the dreamlike stillness in Gerhard Richter’s portraits, or the raw vulnerability in works by contemporary oil painters I follow online. Their work reminds me to take risks, to stay curious, and to be patient with the slow unfolding of an image. Oil painting teaches me to embrace the unknown and to find beauty in the process, not just the result. Every canvas is a lesson, a memory, and a story told through layers.

    <h2>ONLINE DRAWING</h2>
    <p>   
When it comes to my online drawing process, I love how digital tools open up endless possibilities for experimentation and refinement. Starting with rough sketches on my tablet, I can quickly explore different ideas without worrying about wasting paper or materials. I often draw inspiration from online platforms like Pinterest and art communities where I discover fresh techniques and styles shared by other artists. The ability to zoom in, undo, and layer elements allows me to fine-tune details and colors until the piece feels just right. Digital drawing not only speeds up my workflow but also encourages me to push boundaries and keep evolving my artistic voice in ways that traditional mediums sometimes can't.
